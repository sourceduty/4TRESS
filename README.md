> I find myself constantly searching through Steam, hoping to stumble upon an FPS base builder that includes zombies or AI enemies in its gameplay. Games like Fortnite and Rust are great, but they don't offer the specific experience I'm looking for; I crave a game that throws hordes of zombies and AI opponents my way, not just a small squad.
